st.markdown("# About The Open field test-system")

st.markdown("""
The open field test is a generally accepted paradigm for measurement of explorative and locomotor behavior in animals. 
It allows the responses to new and unfamiliar environments as well as habituation to the environment to be evaluated. 
Rats and mice tend to avoid brightly illuminated open spaces, so the open field environment acts as an anxiogenic stimulus and allows the measurement of anxiety-induced behaviors.
"""

st.markdown("""
The considered behavioral test has a form of round arena with the chequered-marked sectors and holes. 
The observation procedure on the laboratory animals takes 3-6 minutes. 

The “Open Field” test-system allows to register the general activity of animals. 
To this aim, we fix the quantity of passed sectors together with the number of intersections of the marked center. 
Also, we check how many holes, standings upright with/without supports, standings still and motions on one place the animals did.
